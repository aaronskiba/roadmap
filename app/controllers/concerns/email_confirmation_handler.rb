# EmailConfirmationHandler

# Some users in our db are both unconfirmed AND have no outstanding confirmation_token
# This is true for those users due to the following:
#   - We have not always used Devise's :confirmable module (:confirmable generates a confirmation_token at the time of User creation)
#   - We have set `confirmed_at` and `confirmation_token` to nil via Rake tasks
# This concern is meant to improve the confirmation process for those users
module EmailConfirmationHandler

  # confirmation instructions are "missing" if the user is both unconfirmed AND has no outstanding confirmation_token
  def missing_confirmation_instructions_handled?(user)
    return false if user.confirmed_or_has_confirmation_token?
